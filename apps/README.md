# Athenetz-SV Apps

## Overview

This repository contains two main applications:

### 1. Web (@Athenetz-SV/web)
The `web` application serves as the central hub where all components and features converge. It is built using Next.js and acts as the main entry point for users. The `web` app integrates various functionalities, including those from the `wahlen` app.

### 2. Wahlen (@Athenetz-SV/wahlen)
The `wahlen` application is a standalone app due to its size and complexity. It handles specific functionalities and is integrated into the `web` app through a build process and a catch-all routing mechanism.
