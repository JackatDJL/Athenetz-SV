# Packages Directory

This directory contains two packages:

## UI
This is a direct copy of my `@Jackatdjl`'s DJLUI package. Nobody is allowed to commit anything to this path. To develop the UI, contribute at its own repository: [@jnmprojects/DJLUI](https://github.com/jnmprojects/DJLUI).
Current Version: [1edf620](https://github.com/JnMProjects/DJLUI/commit/1edf62067684ba4c4659c2021a4c47712887461b)

## API
This package handles the API for both apps/subapps. It controls Firebase functions, GitHub API requests, and other related functionalities in one place.
